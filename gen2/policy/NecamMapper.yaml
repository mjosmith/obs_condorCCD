# The default policy file is contained within the obs_base/policy directory of the stack. However, specific entried can be overridden by including them in here (and, indeed, some are mandatory as they don't have equivalents in the default files).
# Even if it were possible and you **only** used the defaults in the obs_base/policy files you still need to include exposures, calibrations, and datasets so that it knows to refer to the defaults in obs_base.
